# udsClient

A Unix Domain Socket Client test.

The class has everything you need to set up a local socket. 
The main file just runs a test.

Use together with the udsListener to run the test.

This program as-is simply sends a Hello World to the local listener.
But the client class can be used in other applications for IPC.
